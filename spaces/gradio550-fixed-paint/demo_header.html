            WARNING:sometime unstable,you can't draw true black(0,0,0)<br>
            Good for classic inpaint border.<br>
            Paintng good at adding accessories with Flux, using inpainting/img2img, but not great at faces or bodies(only close eyes seems work)<br>
            This is one of My solution for gradio5.5 painting,I dont't know which old version gradio paint work.<br>
            the BUG is <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues/9066">this</a>.I hope it will fix soon<br>
            another solution is not use gradio for paint <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Akjava/godot-web-gradio-inapint">Godot-web-gradio-inpaint</a><br>
