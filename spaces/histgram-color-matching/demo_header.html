        Body-to-body image color matching will never work; try face-to-face.keep eyes and hair color same<br>
        Usually default is best.To similar lighting angle,mirror(flip horizental) is important<br>
        Adding color paint(pink or green) can change hue(but not recommend to add target image)<br>
        modify tone-curve adjust brightness.However most of the case  it's the lighting's issue, so there's not much we can do <br>
        This is scikit-image version,maybe using another lib get another result I've never tried yet.
